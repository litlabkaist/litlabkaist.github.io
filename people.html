                    <p>After earning her B.A. in Korean Literature and working as a journalist, Woori Jang developed a deep interest in patterns of human storytelling and cultural expression. This background led her to study digital humanities as an effective tool for observing and analyzing these patterns. Building on this foundation, her master's research focused on developing methodologies that complement traditional literary criticism through quantitative analysis of literary texts as data. Currently, she studies how Korean science fiction interacts with technological advancement in society, particularly examining how artificial beings like AI are interpreted and represented in literature. Her research combines computational approaches with cultural analytics, using LLMs for text annotation and character analysis. Her work includes “Evaluating LLM Performance in Character Analysis: A Study of Artificial Beings in Recent Korean Science Fiction.”</p>

With a B.A. in Data Science and English Language & Literature, they aim to integrate digital methods into their study, using textual data to analyze narrative and cultural patterns. Additionally, they are particularly interested in examining literature through the lens of feminism and queer theory, exploring how these perspectives shape the reinterpretation of texts. One of their key research topics is the interaction between fanfiction, author, and society, specifically focusing on transgender fanfiction within the Harry Potter fandom.</p>

                    <p>Eunhoo Lee is a Master’s student at the School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Linguistics from Kookmin University. Her thesis research analyzes how space in a closed-circle mystery by Agatha Christie is distorted by readers and how they perceive spatiality in a change of space to place during their reading. The thesis project focuses on spatial network analysis and its visualization in literary geography and narratology and is considered the possible approach to narrative criminology. Eunhoo has participated in several projects, writing the article “Feminism Reboot and the Evolution of Korean BL” as one of three authors and creating a database of classic books in the National Library of Korea.</p>
