The woman has neatly styled, medium-length black hair and is smiling brightly at the camera. She is dressed in a white shirt paired with a black blazer, blue jeans, and a brown belt, presenting a clean and sophisticated look. Standing next to a tree in a relaxed and natural pose, she harmonizes beautifully with the colorful autumn leaves in the background. The photo captures the essence of autumn's charm and conveys a soft, warm emotion, blending nature and the subject seamlessly.">

                    <p class="description">Seohyon Jung is an assistant professor jointly appointed in the School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences and the School of Computing at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). After receiving Ph.D. in English from Tufts University, she received a Humanities Fellowship from the Institute of Humanities at Seoul National University (SNU). She specializes in eighteenth and nineteenth century British literature, examining how fictional works represent historical structures of feeling at the intersections of culture, economy, and scientific discourses. Her current research interests cover the evolving relationships between literature, society and technology, with particular focus on the nineteenth-century understanding of population, capitalist productivity and reproduction, socio-historical conditions of labor, and translation. Please check out the Research section for detailed information on current projects. She is the co-editor of Edges of Transatlantic Commerce in the Long Eighteenth Century (Routledge, 2021), and her works have been published in Journal for the Eighteenth Century Studies, Victorian Literature and Culture, and Brontë Studies, among others. She welcomes collaborations with scholars across disciplines who are interested in innovative approaches to literary and cultural studies.</p>

                    <p class="description">As a master’s student in the School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences and a member of Litlab, Jiwoo’s research interests lie in English literature and its interpretation by diverse audiences. With a B.A. in Data Science and English Language & Literature, they aim to integrate digital methods into their study, using textual data to analyze narrative and cultural patterns. Additionally, they are particularly interested in examining literature through the lens of feminism and queer theory, exploring how these perspectives shape the reinterpretation of texts. One of their key research topics is the interaction between fanfiction, author, and society, specifically focusing on transgender fanfiction within the Harry Potter fandom.</p>

She holds a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Linguistics from Kookmin University. Her thesis research analyzes how space in a closed-circle mystery by Agatha Christie is distorted by readers and how they perceive spatiality in a change of space to place during their reading. The thesis project focuses on spatial network analysis and its visualization in literary geography and narratology and is considered the possible approach to narrative criminology. Eunhoo has participated in several projects, writing the article “Feminism Reboot and the Evolution of Korean BL” as one of three authors and creating a database of classic books in the National Library of Korea.</p>

Based on this scientific knowledge, he aims to shed light on some unrevealed truths that explicitly structure patterns of literary things originating from the past and transform the language of qualitative criticism into computational spaces in digital humanities. He is broadly interested in exploring plural literary image-text corpora and specifically studying the late Victorian little magazines that include fin de siècle illustrations, writings and designs aspiring to “total work of art”, which are measured by various computational techniques and large language models. He is also conducting the research project, Jane Eyre Translation Study. This project aims to classify 15 Korean translations of Jane Eyre leveraging feature engineering and discern the importance of certain features in translations.</p>

                    <p class="description">After earning her B.A. in Korean Literature and working as a journalist, Woori Jang developed a deep interest in patterns of human storytelling and cultural expression. This background led her to study digital humanities as an effective tool for observing and analyzing these patterns. Building on this foundation, her master's research focused on developing methodologies that complement traditional literary criticism through quantitative analysis of literary texts as data. Currently, she studies how Korean science fiction interacts with technological advancement in society, particularly examining how artificial beings like AI are interpreted and represented in literature. Her research combines computational approaches with cultural analytics, using LLMs for text annotation and character analysis. Her work includes “Evaluating LLM Performance in Character Analysis: A Study of Artificial Beings in Recent Korean Science Fiction.”</p>
