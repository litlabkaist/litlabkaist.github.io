                    <p>Eunhoo Lee is a Master’s student at the School of Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Linguistics from Kookmin University. Her thesis research analyzes how space in a closed-circle mystery by Agatha Christie is distorted by readers and how they perceive spatiality in a change of space to place during their reading. The thesis project focuses on spatial network analysis and its visualization in literary geography and narratology and is considered the possible approach to narrative criminology. Eunhoo has participated in several projects, writing the article “Feminism Reboot and the Evolution of Korean BL” as one of three authors and creating a database of classic books in the National Library of Korea.</p>
