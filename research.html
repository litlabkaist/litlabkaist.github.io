                After earning her B.A. in Korean Literature and working as a journalist, Woori Jang developed a deep interest in patterns of human storytelling and cultural expression. This background led her to study digital humanities as an effective tool for observing and analyzing these patterns. Building on this foundation, her master's research focused on developing methodologies that complement traditional literary criticism through quantitative analysis of literary texts as data. Currently, she studies how Korean science fiction interacts with technological advancement in society, particularly examining how artificial beings like AI are interpreted and represented in literature. Her research combines computational approaches with cultural analytics, using LLMs for text annotation and character analysis. Her work includes “Evaluating LLM Performance in Character Analysis: A Study of Artificial Beings in Recent Korean Science Fiction.”

                This project focuses on the transgender fanfiction that emerged within the Harry Potter fandom as a response to J.K. Rowling's transphobic statements posted in 2019. Through text analysis of Harry Potter fanfiction from 2016 to 2023 retrieved from Archives of Our Own, this research discusses the interplay between fanfiction, author, and society, highlighting its distinctive characteristics. Implementing methodologies such as cosine similarity, word embedding, and dimensionality reduction to examine the narrative and shifts in word usage, it argues that fanfiction cannot be seen as mere resistance or reinterpretation but should be recognized as a process of creating a multi-layered, collective narrative that interacts internally while simultaneously engaging with broader societal discourses. Minor genres of fanfiction grow in a way that borrows the schema of the major genres to create their own narratives, and major genres also incorporate features that address social minorities. This study ultimately addresses the question of what fanfiction is and how it should be studied, arguing that its collective feature makes it difficult to capture its landscape with a selected list of works.

                The project addresses nine closed-circle mysteries by Agatha Christie: The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, Death in the Clouds, Problem at Sea, Murder in Mesopotamia, Appointment with Death, And Then There Were None, and Evil Under the Sun. The mysteries address murder among a limited number of suspects in a closed environment, having reasonable means, motives, and opportunities for crime. Their readers experience a plot twist when the detective reveals the truth of the murder, although its clues already exist in the text. The cause is the distorted perception of space in the mysteries by the readers. While reading, they perceive space as a place, starting with the freedom to investigate and ending with the completeness to close the case. During the process, they also feel spatiality based on the temporal interaction among characters, locations, and objects. The change and interaction will be mainly analyzed and visualized as networks on the maps of each mystery from the perspective of readers. The research aims to suggest network visualization as a tool for presenting the relation among spatial, social, and temporal contexts in English detective fiction and implies the possibility of development to narrative criminology.
