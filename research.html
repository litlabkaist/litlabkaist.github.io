                    After earning her B.A. in Korean Literature and working as a journalist, Woori Jang developed a deep interest in patterns of human storytelling and cultural expression. This background led her to study digital humanities as an effective tool for observing and analyzing these patterns. Building on this foundation, her master's research focused on developing methodologies that complement traditional literary criticism through quantitative analysis of literary texts as data. Currently, she studies how Korean science fiction interacts with technological advancement in society, particularly examining how artificial beings like AI are interpreted and represented in literature. Her research combines computational approaches with cultural analytics, using LLMs for text annotation and character analysis. Her work includes “Evaluating LLM Performance in Character Analysis: A Study of Artificial Beings in Recent Korean Science Fiction.”

                    This project focuses on the transgender fanfiction that emerged within the Harry Potter fandom as a response to J.K. Rowling's transphobic statements posted in 2019. Through text analysis of Harry Potter fanfiction from 2016 to 2023 retrieved from Archives of Our Own, this research discusses the interplay between fanfiction, author, and society, highlighting its distinctive characteristics. Implementing methodologies such as cosine similarity, word embedding, and dimensionality reduction to examine the narrative and shifts in word usage, it argues that fanfiction cannot be seen as mere resistance or reinterpretation but should be recognized as a process of creating a multi-layered, collective narrative that interacts internally while simultaneously engaging with broader societal discourses. Minor genres of fanfiction grow in a way that borrows the schema of the major genres to create their own narratives, and major genres also incorporate features that address social minorities. This study ultimately addresses the question of what fanfiction is and how it should be studied, arguing that its collective feature makes it difficult to capture its landscape with a selected list of works.
